# raspi

For my projec you need to import the tkinter library, News-Api library, the grovepi library, the datetime library, the threading library, the signal library and the World-Time-Api library

Also you will have to attach the screen and the shield to the raspberrypi per the instructions wich can be found here:https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Getting_Started/

Then when you have connected the screen and the shield you will need too connect the buzzer to the shile at active Port 8 

When everything is connected you are all set to start the Programm.

When you have started the Programm wou will see a blank screen with two buttons, the top right one beeing to stop the programm and the top left one beeing where you will need to set the wakeup time.

When you are beeing woken up the button "let me sleep" will appear, when it is pressed the buzzing will stop and the top news will appear.you can then clode the window with the close button and you will be woken
up the next morning at the same time if you chose not to change the time.
